a small toybox mod - become the toy, become a doll!
</center>

---

would you be a doll? i certainly would, so i made this collection of toyful tweaks for #dollgamers at toybox
- dolls are small!
- dolls don't always feel like speaking up
- dolls can be used to play dress up!
- dolls can be made of a variety(3) of materials
- dolls can be secured to a player's shoulders with ribbon
- dolls can be renamed (only in world) with a nametag
- dolls are immune to drowning and freezing
- dolls are sustained by repairs instead of food (use your dollcraft item with sticks/clay/string in inventory)
- dolls can be repaired by others
- but could there be more coming?

### how to:

you'll need to craft one of the three dollcraft items to become a doll!
* carving knife - like an iron sword but with iron nuggets
* modeling tool - like a carving knife but with two more nuggets on the sides
* sewing needle - like a fishing rod without the string. and made of iron nuggets

once you've got that ready, just grab a fragment of your self's essence (conveniently works like a bundle - right click yourself!)
and combine your dollcraft item with the essence fragment in crafting - congrats, you're crafting your essence now!
now pop that right back in with the rest of your self's essence (again, much like a bundle - left click yourself!)
and voila, you're a doll!

ah, if you wish to return to being a player and not a doll, do the same thing but with a pickaxe instead of a dollcraft item.

other players can play with you like an armor stand when they crouch,
and if they craft a ribbon (four strings around a stick),
they can tie you onto their shoulder with it!
(right click a doll to tie on, shift+rclick to untie all dolls)

oh, and uhh.. as a doll, if you want others to hear you in chat, you may need to SPEAK UP a bit.
(or bypass this system with a \ in front of your message, but that's less fun and makes me sad.
there's also config to customize or disable this, which makes me happy!)
