a small toybox mod - become the toy, become a doll!
</center>

---

would you be a doll? i certainly would, so i made this collection of toyful tweaks for #dollgamers at toybox
- dolls are small!
- dolls don't always feel like speaking up
- dolls can be used to play dress up!
- dolls can be made of a variety(3) of materials
- dolls can be secured to a player's shoulders with ribbon
- but could there be more coming?

---

### how to:

craft one of the three dollcraft items and *[right click? that's not right. this'll be changed later]* to become a doll!
*[you can also click again to stop being a doll.. no, that's definitely not right. this is certainly getting changed]*
* carving knife - like an iron sword but with iron nuggets
* modeling tool - like a carving knife but with two more nuggets on the sides
* sewing needle - like a fishing rod without the string. and made of iron nuggets

once you've become a doll, that's it! have fun!

other players can play with you like an armor stand when they crouch,
and if they craft a ribbon (four strings around a stick),
they can tie you onto their shoulder with it!
(right click a doll to tie on, shift+rclick to untie all dolls)

oh, and uhh.. as a doll, if you want others to hear you in chat, you may need to SPEAK UP a bit.
(or bypass this system with a \ in front of your message, but that's less fun and makes me sad)
