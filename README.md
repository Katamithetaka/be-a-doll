a small toybox mod - become the toy, become a doll!
</center>

---

would you be a doll? i certainly would, so i made this collection of toyful tweaks for #dollgamers at toybox
- dolls are small!
- dolls don't always feel like speaking up
- dolls can be used to play dress up!
- dolls can be made of a variety(3) of materials
- dolls can be secured to a player's shoulders with ribbon
- but could there be more coming?
